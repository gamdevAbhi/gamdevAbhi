## 👋 Hi, I’m @gamdevAbhi

I’m a passionate game developer and programming enthusiast. I specialize in creating systems, building game engines, and solving complex challenges related to performance and architecture. I focus on continually improving myself and learning new techniques and tools that push my limits.

## 👀 About Me

I’m interested in:
- **Game Development:** From design to implementation, I am constantly experimenting with new game mechanics, systems, and architectures.
- **System Programming:** Low-level programming, threading, memory management, and concurrency are areas I love to explore.
- **Mobile Development:** I build tools and systems for Android and mobile gaming platforms.

## 🌱 I’m Currently Working On:

- **Personal Projects:** I’m working on various personal projects like games and software applications that push my skills. These include experiments with games, softwares, game engine etc.

- **Tool Creation:** I’m developing tools to optimize my game development pipeline—such as a thread pool, custom hash table, and an image generator—to make development more efficient.

- **Learning & Experimenting:** I’m diving deep into topics like thread management, data structures, low level programming to improve both my technical knowledge and practical implementation skills.

## 💞️ Let’s Collaborate!

I’m always looking to collaborate with fellow developers on exciting game projects. I’m particularly interested in:

- Game mechanics design
- Performance optimizations
- Building robust and scalable systems
- Experimenting with AI and procedural content

If you’re working on a game or tool and need someone to help out with the backend or low-level programming, feel free to reach out!
